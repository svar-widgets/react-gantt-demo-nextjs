# SVAR React Gantt + Next.js Demo

Demo project showing how to integrate free, open-source [SVAR React Gantt](https://svar.dev/react/gantt/) into a Next.js (App Router) application with TypeScript.

This repository demonstrates:

- Adding an interactive Gantt chart to a Next.js project
- Using SVAR Gantt’s Toolbar and Editor for task management
- Persisting tasks and links with a backend (SQLite + REST API)
- Addressing practical Next.js considerations such as CSS imports, SSR hydration warnings, and full-page layouts
- Implementing row reordering, drag-and-drop, and editing operations

Find the integration guide (2 parts) in the SVAR Gantt documentation: [Next.js Integration](https://docs.svar.dev/react/gantt/category/nextjs)
